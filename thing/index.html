    <p>You (unfortunately) are a phrog. So to satiate your endless satanic hunger, you need to eat as much as you can in 60 seconds!</p>
    <p>Move your mouse and left click to aim and shoot your tongue towards your prey</p>
    <p>flies are worth 1 point, while dragonflies are worth 5, but make sure not to touch the trash (league players), or else you'll lose time!</p>

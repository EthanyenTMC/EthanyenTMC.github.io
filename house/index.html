    <p class="thin">This is detective Michael Tritter. One day, Tritter goes to a clinic to get his 
        "special stick" checked. He waits 2 hours at the clinic, and once he eventually 
        does get into the check-up room, House treats him like shit. While house is about 
        to leave the clinic room, Tritter even ends up kicking his cane causing House to 
        trip. House then angrily uses an anal thermometer on tritter, and before taking it
        out, house just leaves the room, leaving tritter there alone for hours with the 
        thermometer in his ass. Turns out, Tritter was actually a police officer, so now 
        he's trying to bust House's drug addiction as revenge! (his real motives are that
        he wants to give house a hard time so he'll learn to be nicer to people)
